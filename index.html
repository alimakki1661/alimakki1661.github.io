  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    This website is hosted using GitHub Pages. This is my portfolio for my labs and projects.
    I've taken multiple CS classes so far, including CSC 326, CSC 211, CSC 221, CSC 245, and CSC 126.
    These classes helped me sharpen my C++ and Jupyter skills. I also learned a lot about networking
    and security. My strongest programming language is currently C++, and I plan to study Java
    and Python as well.
